<h3>Post-deployment Tasks (once the site has been created, tested, and launched into production):</h3>
- Create a cost management plan (i.e./ monitor how much the site is costing me to run. Don't want to break da bank after all).
- Pentest my site just for giggles.
- Setup the link on Social Media. Fugg yeah
